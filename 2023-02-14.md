### Qualitative contributions

Continuing with peer review extensively on GitHub despite delays in meeting schedule.

Editors looking forward to increasing our activity (identified in this period's one CIP meeting) in Cardano Problem Statement submissions to provide detailed feedback on CPSs to outline to authors the kind of detail that is expected (a few of them are stalled because no much can be done with a vague CPS or one not related to current or possible CIPs).
