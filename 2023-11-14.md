### Qualitative contributions

Meeting #75 (17 October) is the first meeting since the summer season well attended on Discord: average of 12 in the meeting chat at any time (as many as 14), with observers participating in CIP verbal review & reading through GitHub comments on progressing proposals.  We appear re-entering an active season of interest in CIPs both from potential authors and the community.

Messaging privately with PR #611 author to confirm process for CIP editors (on one repository) to commit editorial changes on a CIP submitted from another organisational repository... with documentation pending my Q2 milestone, from where it can be documented from our messages & public discussion beginning here: (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/611#pullrequestreview-1693824969)

### Community discussions

Outside the CIP repository I've reviewed the release candidate for Cardano-Swaps, prior to launching its documentation and reference (beta) implementation... a proposal for fully distributed DEX, which consolidates work on (about 4) CIPs for prerequisite issues like transaction chaining: https://github.com/fallen-icarus/cardano-swaps/pull/10#pullrequestreview-1716757239

### Work on pull requests

#466 - CIP-0089? | Beacon Tokens & Distributed Dapps

-   Out-of-band progress on Cardano-Swaps repository triggering a re-review of stalled CIP which will lead to better framework for transaction tagging & Cardano's ability to decentralise databases & exchanges (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/466#pullrequestreview-1728742868)

#509 - CIP-0095? | Web-Wallet Bridge | Governance

-   I approved although we (Adam Dean & I) acknowledged Ryan's ongoing issue of perhaps being required to split some key definitions into a separate CIP (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/509#pullrequestreview-1633743013).
-   Merging for same reason, now that pending separate CIP issue documented.

#523 - CIP-0068 | Bump version for RFT

-   Progressing old CIP update essential to community & sharing responsibility for resolving merge conflict to heavily edited material (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/523#issuecomment-1806364727)

#546 - CIP-0099? | Proof of Onboarding

-   Resuming review after a month of waiting author update, with goal of merging soon (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/546#pullrequestreview-1725876278)

#551 - CIP-0102? | Royalty Datum Metadata

-   author Sam Delaney present at meeting # 75 for final summary & review (for royalty extensions, it does for CIP68 what CIP27 did for CIP25).
-   ready to merge once Sam, Ryan and I coordinate final document corrections beginning here (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/551#discussion_r1362452187)
-   also I'm clarifying that CDDL can be used as a code tag on GitHub (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/551#issuecomment-1766879138)
-   pending changes from last round review: coordinating with other editors and community review (may need new PR) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/551#issuecomment-1776413731)

#556 - CIP-0100? | Governance Metadata

-   Not ready to progress yet since Pi is still feeding back output from 3 governance metadata workshops (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/556#issuecomment-1811723601)

#576 - CIP-1694 | Design changes after the Edinburgh workshop

-   Other editors & I observed this reflects all presentations of IOG cohort and anticipated that any further call for "any last objections" wouldn't be productive given IOG & editor unanimity.
-   Therefore merged to provide an even better baseline (incorporating more refinements) against which further refinements can be made.

#577 - CIP-0030 | Encourage namespaced extension endpoints 

-   Not merging this yet had also hung up long standing merge of CIP-0095 which had also been modified in editorial process to use namespaced endpoints.
-   IOG Lace developer had raised critical objection but this did not reflect the position of entire Lace team (one other was in favour of it).
-   Commented to indicate editor consensus for meeting # 73 and merged.

#586 - CIP-0067, CIP-0068 | Add Clarification for Edits and Modification

-   Versioning statement was addressed as per my request (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/586#discussion_r1362402668)
-   Also mistakenly submitted as Meta (author error) & will change to Tokens.
-   Progression with eye of merging soon (hopefully meeting # 76) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/586#pullrequestreview-1721656098)

#593 - CIP-0025 | Change "NFT" to "token"

-   All editors in favour after other editors & I hypothesised potential problems (see last month's report) & dismissed them: a nomenclature change in favour of accuracy which we believe could only be seen by community as improvement.
-   Meeting # 73 moved this to Last Check for meeting # 74 to give community time to voice any reservations.

#594 - CIP-0001 | Titles for CIPs with common purpose

-   My own submission.
-   Increasingly we have CIPs with common elements (wallet API, new token types) and this suggests prefixing the names with a category readers can immediately recognise as related to a common subject... without having to look up a "related CIP" number or link.
-   posted CIP-0001 update (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/594#issue-1903645017)
-   effectively resolves (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/590#issuecomment-1726391350)
-   updating affected CIPs, e.g. (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/587#issuecomment-1726405546)

#597 - Conway Era Key Chains for HD Wallets

-   Promoting to CIP candidate & confirming Last Check at next meeting: a great step forward by co-editor Ryan towards governance implementation for Cardano end users (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/597#issuecomment-1811694513)

#601 - CIP-0030 | Fix API headers for markdown portability

-   My own submission: has been popular with CIP authors & editors and agreed to be robust.
-   Also agreed to update CIP-0001 someday with language to say that code must be tagged with code tags, especially headers where the parsing problems have been most obvious.
-   CIP authors are cooperating with these recommendations, as announced in meeting # 75 and e.g. committed here (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/587/commits/508ea0557bcd17d793da90312789165dcef8a4db)

#605 - Domain Address Resolving Standard

-   NEW CIP - I'm the first to review (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/605#pullrequestreview-1678467469)
-   Unsure if it's not promotional for company; mainly asked for more detail, checklist of buy-in from wallets who will implement it, and other things a general wallet standard would require.
-   Resolution at meeting # 75 (author present) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/605#issuecomment-1766875377)
-   ... agreed it's a "best practice" document that would be better as a CPS; I introduced the concept of the Cardano Problem Statement and the author will rewrite it as such.
-   ...Also recommended specific implementations for conflict resolution can be presented as a CIP in a separate document, e.g. his reference implementation.
-   Promoting to CPS candidate & inviting professional review from Anastasia Labs (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/605#pullrequestreview-1731129338)

#608 - Deterministic universal almost-unique Plutus Constructors

-   Initial review; confirming compliance with CIP-0035 is not required; and inviting IOG and MLabs Plutus teams to review (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/608#pullrequestreview-1693983373)
-   Not looking good from meeting about potential as CIP yet, unless author can draw together some use cases & respond to submitted reviews from Plutus experts (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/608#issuecomment-1811720014)

#611 - Coin Selection Including Native Tokens

-   Initial review of new CPS to complete CIP-2 for native tokens (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/611#pullrequestreview-1693830520)
-   Promoting to CPS candidate & including discussion on nodejs package already in use for this purpose (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/611#pullrequestreview-1731138083)

#612 - CIP-0072 | Off-chain schema versioning, new categories

-   Updates requested by Lace team: first contact & initial review (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/612#pullrequestreview-1693920811)
-   Confirming implementations are still informal enough to allow changes to dApp metadata standards (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/612#discussion_r1369900011)
-   Affirmative review & presentation at next meeting (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/612#pullrequestreview-1700141088)
-   Editors feedback to add flexible, future proof list of social network links (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/612#discussion_r1387469175)

#617 - dApp-MutlisigWallet Web Bridge

-   Initial review along with Adam Dean, agreeing that this could/should be an extension in spite of author's intent... scheduling discussion at upcoming meeting to settle this (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/617#pullrequestreview-1726110803)
-   Continuing discussion & recommendations for interdependence with CIP-0030, with "breaking change" on existing huge body of Cardano dApps (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/617#issuecomment-1807294098)
-   Successfully got author to re-work it as a proper CIP-0030 extension (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/617#issuecomment-1811727674)

### Work on issues

https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/590

-   Agreed to use pipe (|) instead of dash to help fix YAML parsing problems.
-   Other editors (Ryan & Adam) confirm it avoids the "mapping" error in these contexts.
