### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Discussion — beginning in CIP review, extending into CIP Meeting, and then back again to GitHub as a vital topic for CIP process evolution — of how very long & complex CIPs (especially those used as bases for governance decisions) can be organised so non-expert readers (like SPOs and voters) can understand their basic intent & specifications
* (originating from this point) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1065#issuecomment-3148586023
* (progressing into this issue & draft recommendations) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1075#issuecomment-3205968189

Editor & community debate on whether "multi node" compliance should be included in CIPs: particularly, how that might be done while still preserving the spirit of congruence between all Cardano nodes no matter what their development status or popularity (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1070#pullrequestreview-3136199760)

Developing "feature completeness" list and ensuring cooperative improvements will be made to [cips.cardano.org](https://cips.cardano.org):
* intra-CIP links (currently buggy): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/51
* automatic production of content outlines from headers (already produced on GitHub & other Markdown CMS like Docusaurus): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/52
* more functional sidebar with CIP/CPS metadata parsing and faceted sort/search:
  * https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/53#issuecomment-3223903163
  * https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/53#issuecomment-3232881012

Earmarking "audit" CIPs, with problematic classification before, as potentially applicable to planned `Governance` category: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/252#issuecomment-3196393861

A new request for classification through applying any number of system-specific "tags" in addition to the long-time single "Category", with due consideration & escalation to CIP meeting (pending in September) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1076#issuecomment-3239415500)
