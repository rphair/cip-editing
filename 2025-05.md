### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Launching & moderating discussion of "new type" `CRC` (community standards & best practices, after Etherum's `ERC`) based on requests by influential community developers for a higher-bandwidth documentation process for specifications the community depends upon: particularly the Ledger: including considerations of where this repository would be located & what the editorial process would be (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1040)

Continuation of discussion & controversy on Cardano Forum about whether the CIP process should be "overhauled" or "replaced" due to its long-standing requirement that community (developer _and_ architect) consensus be maintained especially in vital cases like the Ledger (https://forum.cardano.org/t/managing-a-shared-ledger-new-cip-like-process/145575/2)

Request for more essential "rich formatting" on [cips.cardano.org](https://cips.cardano.org): this time, for [GitHub Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/46)

  - after CIP meeting (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1031#issuecomment-2877761111)
