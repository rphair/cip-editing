### Qualitative contributions

After last month's increase in activity and open PRs, the number of open issues has reduced again because of a group push to continue proposals that have been in an indeterminate state.

Often proposal authors post on Discord to find the best way to progress their proposals.  Sometimes in fact editors have been waiting for author activity, which we can then be more explicit about (in terms of what we've been expecting)... and also this better dialogue has caught a couple of cases where old PRs had become less visible due to backlog and lack of recent review comments.  Therefore I believe this better communication has had noticeable effects to start clearing up the backlog.



### 2023-04-04 CIP Editors Meeting #63

agenda (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15HCJDR-Wr-8kEhZpyVk_NszpZACyf1zAYtcSTUgLLcE)

- actual discussion not strictly following agenda: not widely distributed before meeting, prepared by editor who wasn't present, plus editors and attendees alike are caught off guard by time zone change.
- problems also related to Discord (I requested review at our upcoming planned "editors only" meeting: Sebastien not able to hear Robert even after restarting (the standard solution).  We used "chat" as a back-fill as I typed my responses about each PR (hence less typing below this time):

#### (added upon request by attendees)

CIP-0072? | DApp Registration & Discovery ([#355](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/355))

-   author & contributors present.
-   related to Smart Contract Blueprints (though these aren't meant to be on-chain)
-   Lace developer showed up & confirmed it's ready for implementation.
-   BUT can't merge since still missing Rationale, Path to Active, Copyright, etc.
    -   Ryan already noted these & author still has to complete standard CIP format.
    -   Authors say they'll work on that.
-   Seba has left comment summarising all this, including Lace wallet launch.

CIP-0001 | Add extended taxonomy (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/493)

-   This guy kind of elbowed his way into the agenda... I posted Matthias' rebuttal about why we don't need this proposal nor the "types" that were thrown out with the original version of the CIP process.
-   It's a step backward by an author who's not really familiar with this evolution & hasn't been involved with the CIP process yet.
-   Posted this summary in Discord chat but no response (still can't speak & losing Internet connection)

#### Triage

Authenticated Web3 HTTP Requests - discussion continues on GitHub

ERC20-like Assets - not requiring triage (extensive discussion already on GitHub)

Supercharged Native Scripts (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/479) - @nielstron = Niels MÃ¼ndler

-   Sebastien suggested using "his" CIP-38 for this instead because it wouldn't involve changing Plutus.
-   Neither he nor anyone else understands what his is really all about about.
-   @matiwinnetou will ask author to attend the next meeting to introduce it & explain more about why he feels this is needed.
-   Seba characterises this as a "design pattern" for scripts.
    -   interested in author's description of why this doesn't require changes to ledger
-   later in the meeting the author arrives, saying:
    -   Sebastien is drawing out a good description of how this would be used in practice.
    -   From a web design perspective it does sound like a "design pattern" as term is employed in web design.
-   RESOLUTION it's a work in progress & proceeding well enough on GitHub (including refuting with alternatives & competing methods... author has invited these from attendees)
-   I invited MPJ to review it, but people are already offering simpler alternatives.

(CPS) Voltaire Governance

-   Originally posted as a CIP which had to be closed, after getting a huge amount of feedback from community... author is still catching up & not much to do with it at this meeting.

Extend Token Metadata for translations

-   Problem: they extended the JSON notation instead of the CDDL notation.
-   Also one of the devs thinks it will work better with "locale" instead of language tags.
-   (authors still haven't responded to this particular reservation)

(CPS) Properly burning NFT/Tokens

-   Recent comment on GitHub suggests a different way of dealing with this.
-   No CIP for it yet so no hurry to push this one forward.

#### Review

CPS-0001 | Metadata discoverability and trust - ongoing technical review

CPS-0002 | Pointer addresses - insufficient time on agenda

CPS-0003 | Smart Tokens

-   It's a "container" for other CPSs including the "rejected" CIP70.
-   Discussion is still continuing on this.

CPS-0004 | Spending Script Redundant Execution

-   No Plutus representatives present so can't really talk about this one further.

#### Last Check

CIP-0057? | Plutus smart-contract blueprints - still under discussion.
