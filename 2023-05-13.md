### Qualitative contributions

After last month's increase in activity as well as the usual rate of opening new CIP PRs, the number of open issues is roughly the same because of a group push to continue proposals that have been in an indeterminate state.  After some cleaning up of PFs which have been abandoned by authors I expect we will soon return to the balance of open PRs which we had last year.

Often proposal authors post on Discord to find the best way to progress their proposals.  Sometimes in fact editors have been waiting for author activity, which we can then be more explicit about (in terms of what we've been expecting)... and also this better dialogue has caught a couple of cases where old PRs had become less visible due to backlog and lack of recent review comments.  Therefore I believe this better communication has had noticeable effects to start clearing up the backlog.
