### Qualitative contributions

New category of CIP PRs and issues: extensions to CIP-0088; see
- discussion of new potential standards being added: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/790#discussion_r1537898249
- new GitHub label visible here: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/labels/CIP-0088%3A%20new%20extension

Continuing & completing my own update of CIP-0001 to help manage lists of co-authors & workshop attendees to define how these should appear without overwhelming the CIP body text:
- (for CIP-1694) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/763#issuecomment-1972910451)
- (Discord: suggesting for other proposals) (https://discord.com/channels/971785110770831360/992011119872970762/1214634845939171398)
- (for CIP-0100; Ryan is handling other proposals) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/776)
- (for foreign language versions) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/777)

Continuing & completing my further update of CIP-0001 to ensure all CPS files have a proper open source license (an item originaly missing from the CPS specification in CIP-9999):
- (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/764#issuecomment-1988202916)

Administrative fixes to CIP formats affecting compatibility with derived sites (e.g. the Dev Portal) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/773)

### Community discussions

Discord: we've "fixed" CIP-1694 by popular demand that the attendees list for all the workshops was overwhelming at the beginning ofthe proposal & moved it to the end (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/763); but there was a suggestion that this might also be true for other CIPs, so I'm polling devs to see which ones that might be (candidates so far: CIP-0100 and CIP-0108).
- https://discord.com/channels/971785110770831360/992011119872970762/1214634845939171398

Thanks to GitHub support (and without editors having admin privileges on CIPs repository), removed all comments from the repo's most notorious and repeated spammer (therefore this search no longer shows any results) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3ACeliaparra)
