### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Passionate & initially polarised community discussion about whether AI LLM assistance is permissible in CIP and CPS writing:
- "case study" of CPS-0021 which showcased process & results of CPS text flaggable as AI-written but still eminently recognisable as original creative work by author (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1009#issuecomment-2786000599)
- discussion issue to document guidelines for the Wiki (to which this CPS author contributed substantially) based on community consensus of what constitutes "originally" more importanly than language itself (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1017#issuecomment-2786107650) (several comments to follow)

Updating agenda template to allow editors to tag *issues* for presentation & discussion at meeting by applying `Triage` tag as we long have done (only) for pull requests, to automatically include these on the agenda (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22State%3A+Triage%22+sort%3Acreated-asc)

Discussing whether Ledger changes need something in parallel to the CIP process about change commitments or more granular updates:
- (Cardano Forum: Managing a Shared Ledger: New CIP-Like Process?)[https://forum.cardano.org/t/managing-a-shared-ledger-new-cip-like-process/145575/2]
- (on GitHub) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1028#issuecomment-2824310183

Co-writing with co-editor Ryan updates to CIP template to qualify any AI usage in preparation of CIPs and CIPs (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1026#pullrequestreview-2772367886)
