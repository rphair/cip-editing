### Qualitative contributions

Final discussions with editors and long time community reviewers to complete my updates to the CIP and CIPs templates begun in the last monthly cycle, regaring _References_ and other optional sections and how versioning is handled (with options for integrating into document or providing a _Versioning_ section):
- https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/730 (to update CIP format)
- https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/731
- https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/756 (to update CPS format)

### Community discussions

Should repeat spammers to the CIP repository be banned?  So far editor concensus is no, but only because none of the editors have privileges to block anyone.  Keeping an eye on this matter, e.g.:
- https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/744#issuecomment-1897746980
- https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/755
