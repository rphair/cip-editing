### Qualitative contributions

#### Subjective progress

The busiest month so far this year, with many long time issues converging:

First a conclusion to the long effort to obtain & restore full "proposed" status to Reward Sharing Scheme (RSS) CIPs:

-   (my public announcement) https://twitter.com/COSDpool/status/1675495813571837953
-   (my work to reconcile the outstanding & uncertain RSS proposals) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/536
-   (my suggested language which finally clarified matters of responsibility) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/456#issuecomment-1585558784

Critics of CIP-1694 on GitHub, after merging this CIP draft to consolidate consensus driven changes and provide a basis for editing parts of it individually, accused IOG and CIP editors of rubber-stamping the proposal without agreement.  Everyone knows I am not affiliated with IOG although I would still be covered by this accusation, so I felt comfortable and well qualified to reassure the community over this issue:

The technical necessity of merging this proposal was well documented by Matthias here:

-   (first message) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380#issuecomment-1614916372
-   (response to anticipated criticism) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380#issuecomment-1615855938

which I followed up for some neutral third parties in the community on the Matrix MBO ([link](https://matrix.to/#/%21BUHksrKFIXqVJCuFzQ:matrix.org/$_9tAHTyaefLBZXTSBBfy648wYHoRnE4mNj0_CyaHAaQ?via=matrix.org&via=matrix.adamantium.online&via=forum.balanceanalytics.io)) indicating that this CIP has been merged for quite uninteresting reasons without any emotional or political charge whatsoever, as some of CIP-1694 most vocal critics prepared for IOG to host them and their particular statements in the workshop at Edinburgh the following week: in my opinion demonstrating the best aspects of constructive dialogue and consensus: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380#issuecomment-1629312879

This leads to the related question about whether there should be a Constitution for CIP editors ([link](https://app.element.io/#/room/%21BUHksrKFIXqVJCuFzQ%3Amatrix.org/%24qf9BYXKqY1Q20cbbzoEBZjgoOAKse6A0pBaBeFKCOEo?via=matrix.org&via=matrix.adamantium.online&via=forum.balanceanalytics.io)) which has effectively become part of my planned milestone in an application for further funding and accountability through Catalyst Fund10, with the following goal emerging from our community discussion (as I wrote):

> From the beginning the first CIP editing committee intended (and I supported, being the first person to arrive beyond the original group) that there should be complete visibility on the GitHub repo alone. That has the maybe unfortunate consequence that the entire body of CIPs, reviews, comments, tags, commits & merges (plus meeting agenda & notes now) ***is*** the training material.
> 
> It has the *advantage* that this steep learning curve reinforces the idea to ourselves & others that subjectivity cannot be part of the process, as there would be if there were "training materials" in writing or video to narrow reviewers' and editors' focus to the most "essential" things. Without that, we can only continue the precedent of attention to every detail about how any CIP might be technically contested or poorly documented.
>
> For me (and this process didn't come naturally, though my interest in detail suited me well for it), to see the kind of flaws that would weaken a CIP took regular attendance at CIP Editors' meetings *and* subscribing to *all* the CIP repo postings by email & reading them every day. Like the "constitution" question I also think this is too simple an idea to be officially documented... but in writing the Catalyst proposal for my next years' funding you are making me want to include something about a time budget to expand the CIP committee... so I might include a statement about training, documentation & maybe even mentorship.

#### GitHub progress, independently of meetings

First internationalisation of a CIP (French version of CIP-1694): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/539#pullrequestreview-1511148368

Extended CIP-0001 to cover internationalized content; co-developed standards requirement for documents with Matthias: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/542

A challenging & successful review of CIP-0096 (On-chain dApp Certification Metadata), with several passes of many comments checked point-by-point and resolved: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/499#pullrequestreview-1486643592

I proposed a clarified processes for asset name labels (current case: Ada Subhandle): cross-discipline collaboration including requirements from Blockfrost and common classifications of minted assets (CIP-0067 and CIP-0068): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/504#issuecomment-1598272600

new Plutus curve introduction (keccak256): getting coordination with Plutus team: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/524#pullrequestreview-1487638941

Resolved what do with with OLD RSS proposals that aren't merged?

-   Deprecate, if abandoned by author: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/387#issuecomment-1630667969:
-   Merging some anyway even if abandoned by author (CIP50, very popular in community): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/242#pullrequestreview-1524113178

progressing CIP-1694 now that edits have expanded:

-   (cleanup & consistency) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/547
-   (source documentation links) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/548

#### 2023-07-04 CIP Editors Meeting #69 June 20th, 4:00 pm (UTC)

agenda (https://hackmd.io/@cip-editors/69)

-   Invited Plutus people via Github, with confirmation(s).
-   Agenda customised by Robert (Anthony not present for last 2 meetings) to extend & make contiguous the Plutus schedule (this helped with attendance and participation).
-   Also some trivial & already-merged PRs replaced with more appropriate Review items, with some of the routine work therefore accomplished before the meeting.

##### Triage

CIP-0060 | Fix relative links (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/525)

-   OK to merge on the spot: a simple maintenance change.
-   This set a good precedent because in week after the meeting we were able to fix & merge several of these "update" CIPs in the same way.

##### Review

CIP-???? | Integration of keccak256 into Plutus (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/524)

-   Inigo (secondary author) invited & present: reaffirms this is required for interoperability with Ethereum.
-   Also @effectfully arrived to speak for Michael Peyton-Jones.
-   Remains in progress but Plutus team has progressed "costing" issue on the basis of meeting discussion & got review from subject matter expert Kenneth on the IOG Plutus team:
-   Agreed to assign number & merge as Proposed ASAP based on this expected effort: visible on GitHub now.
-   MY SUMMARY: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/524#issuecomment-1620567059

CIP-0381 | Adapt to Plutus bindings (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/506)

-   Inigo, primary author is here; also going to get Kenneth's review on particulars.
-   CIP-0381 was not Plutus specific (kind of "generic"), so language interface is taking some time; he will tag "Kenneth" re: compression issue.
-   MY SUMMARY (it's progressing well): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/506#issuecomment-1630741312

CIP-0097? | Representing the Script Context as a SOP term (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/507)

-   Invited MPJ; "Effectfully" has come in his place.
-   Group admits this is "on hold for now" at proposal level: they're not sure this is the right way to solve this problem.  MPJ confirms this in meeting chat.
-   I marked Waiting for author after this clarifying comment (authors also agree).
-   MY SUMMARY: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/507#issuecomment-1620574395

CIP-0095? | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge Governance Extension (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/509)

-   Ryan is here & leading discussion.
-   Needs more feedback & more critique, which they *abundantly* got in a full day @ the Edinburgh workshop the following week (IOG Hackathon on 13 July)
-   Follow-up notes on workshop (Ryan): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/509#issuecomment-1636103821

CIP-0067 | add ADA Handles Virtual SubHandle (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/504)

-   My report: Thomas (IOG Education advocate for the ADAHandle guys, CIP-0067 & 0068 auto-author) can't come today but promises a response on GitHub that we were prepared to receive two weeks ago:
-   MY SUMMARY (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/504#issuecomment-1620581263)
-   ... Thomas counters that this is pending his available time & not really a priority, which is understandable, and his help will be appreciated whenever it comes.
-   Therefore this is Waiting for Author until one of the ADAHandle team and/or Thomas can provide a definition of what they really need & how our existing CIPs need to be adjusted for similar requests... something I requested 2-3 months ago.

CIP-0093? | Authenticated Web3 HTTP requests (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/442)

-   Juan (author) is here and fields significant question from Sebastien and others that CIP8 might be a better way to handle these authenticated messages.
-   This initiates a long GitHub dialogue in which I accept the conclusion that the CIP8 reconciliation can be done in another CIP
-   ... MY SUMMARY: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/442#issuecomment-1625222480
-   Therefore this long awaited CIP remains on track and on Last Check for next meeting, with all the difficult issues resolved.

CIP-0086 | Remove metadata update transaction restrictions (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/521)

-   MERGED as unanimous as I related from teams who are working on CIP-0086 (Mlabs and Equine).

##### Drop-ins

Extend CIP-0001 to cover internationalized content (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/542)

-   Matthias popped it into discussion, which provided us enough basis for to merge it in the week after the meeting, pending a couple of changes per my review (done by Matthias):
-   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/542#pullrequestreview-1513216962
-   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/542#pullrequestreview-1514691330

CIP-0096? | On-chain dApp Certification Metadata (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/499)

-   They want to add certification standards to internal documents in the CIP... answers question from last meeting (about how to link to loosely document "blog" standard).
-   I've formulated that request here and we're awaiting update accordingly from the IOG Certification Working Group: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/499#issuecomment-1605345430
-   ... not really necessary to move on, and @MIxAxIM said this depends on how quickly the arrive at implementations of this proposed standard.

#### 2023-06-20 CIP Editors Meeting #68 9:30 am (UTC)

agenda (https://hackmd.io/@cip-editors/68)

##### Triage

CIP-0086 | Remove metadata update transaction restrictions (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/521)

-   Expected some technical review... see meeting #69 where this was acknowledged complete.

CIP-???? | Integration of keccak256 into Plutus (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/524)

-   Also progressed at, and documented after, meeting #69.Robert covering on agenda.
-   This meeting itself noted that this CIP is important for Ethereum compatibility: currently Plutus has signature scheme but not hash function.

##### Review

CIP-0095? | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge Governance Extension (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/509)

-   Ryan is author & subject matter expert & continuing work on the design described in the proposal.
-   Not Active yet since implementation efforts still in progress.

CIP-0067 | add ADA Handles Virtual SubHandle (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/504)

-   Background for resolutions in meeting #69 where Thomas (IOG Education) confirms:
-   ... he confirmed that CIP 67 and 68 are separate... 68 definitions are only required if the classes are associated with metadata.
-   ... He's not sure that what their team is implementing will be different than just an NFT (with no specification in CIP68 required).
-   I note this means this update might not be required at all & if so we'd be setting a bad precedent by allowing it without strict document about why it's needed.
-   I notes some problems resulting from: Last added label 444 came in with a lot of documentation including a CIP-0068 update, but no such detail to go on here.

Ryan covering on agenda (three similar) three updates to CIP-0030 (documented fully on GitHub in those open PRs).

CIP-0093? | Authenticated Web3 HTTP requests (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/442)

-   Beginning of discussion continued & concluded in & after meeting #69.
-   Also there was a suggestion that the Cardano Foundation (mentioning @matiwinnetou) is using a part of this certification method, but we agreed not to require it in _Path to Active_ which only requires implementation in wallets.

##### Last check: NONE

##### Drop-ins

CIP-0096? | On-chain dApp Certification Metadata #499 (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/499)

-   Documentation of Certification Levels is begun here... and how to record them while they exist only on things like blog pages and internal documents... which is tenatively address & awaiting solution after meeting #69.
