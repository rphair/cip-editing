### Qualitative contributions

Private discussion among CIP editors *not* to deprecate CIP-0013, which in my opinion would derail the very slow-going attempts to universally support Cardano payment URIs and the as-yet unsupported `//stake` links directly to pools & delegation sets; with the result defining the conditions for a new Cardano Problem Statement to coordinate work about this issue: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/836#issuecomment-2170981080

... with rationale given here (not posted yet in GitHub CIPs repo):

> I understand what you are suggesting... and we can get this conversation into the public record if you like (and I would prefer it that way), but I think the last revision of CIP-0013 was comprehensive (and final) mainly since from this point onward there is never going to be any protocol extension that won't be handled by an `//authority` with its own CIP.  That covers _everything_ but the undisputed yet unimplemented `//stake` and the legacy bare "payment" standard that we can't change but which is insufficient for modern needs.
> 
> If you think (as I am coming to think) this needs clarification in a new `## Versioning` section for CIP-0013 then please say so... I'll provide it roughly as above & probably should have done so in https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/559
> 
> I don't think it's necessary to break up CIP-0013 on account of `//stake` links any more than CIP-0068 needs to be deprecated in favour of 3 or 4 separate token standard CIPs.  The difference between Payment and Stake links at the time CIP-0013 was written is that Emurgo was already doing payment links ad-hoc at the time, and Sebastien & Vicente just documented it there after the fact.  Gutting CIP-0013 to overwrite that history would be blurring an unknowable set of payment implementations that I would rather leave well alone.  
> 
> But now there is a clear commercial need to provide a new `//payment` standard, and a clear path forward to outline these in a new CIP that handles the native tokens properly.  If done that way, wallet providers will line up to implement it & likely be more enthusiastic about the other protocol extensions as well.

### Community discussions

Plan for Ledger parameters to be founded on Wiki for separate respository, in anticipation of CIP-1694 focus on governance-based adjustments to parameters (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/847#issuecomment-2191532211)

Continuing issue about precedent for code in CIPs: generally code is insulated from the CIP process to keep questions about support an accountability focused on the responsible developers, but holding up this principle for review & re-affirmation (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/848#pullrequestreview-2145300838)
