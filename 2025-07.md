### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Last month's CIP process update pronounced "A really nice crop of tweaks and improvements; great work" by fellow editor (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1044#pullrequestreview-2998186399)

### Work on pull requests

#444 - CIP-0113? | Programmable tokens
* First attempt after long hiatus (and community enquiries) to get authors to post status for development of this CIP and its reference implementation; appears stalled but still giving authors the benefit of doubt (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/444#issuecomment-3058413147)
* Report from CIP meeting 2 weeks later indicating consequences of uncertainty over this CIP and urging authors to provide more status detail, with practical documentation currently missing from CIP draft: as projects attempting to create such standard tokens are being adversely affected (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/444#issuecomment-3109346578)
* Posting prominently, despite the commercial interest, that this is still `Waiting for Author`, with clear guidelines that the author(s) can use to un-stall it and provide a publicly acceptable standard (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/444#pullrequestreview-3056696710)

#843 - CIP-0157? | Cardano URIs - Enhanced Payments

#972 - CIP-0142? | Web-Wallet Bridge - Network Determination
