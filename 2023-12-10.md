### Qualitative contributions

Supported (inviting key developers & cross referencing discussions
between Discord & GitHub) a monthly period of 2 CIP editor led workshops
(organised by co-editors Ryan and Adam Dean):

1 - Wallet Connectors (2023-11-27): to define the role(s) of a wallet
especially given the latest suggestions to assume dApp-like capabilities
and/or a blockchain query layer.  Not being a wallet or blockchain
developer I've assumed a developer relations role to keep key
contributors involved & keep points of consensus documented.

2 - Governance Metadata (2023-12-04): to document all community feedback
regarding the finalising CIP-0010 (not present due to time discrepancy)

### Community discussions

Got `pandoc` maintainers to fix long standing problem to produce
Markdown (required for CIPs, and these Catalyst reports) from HTML
sources with complicated formatting; this will improve CIP authoring
experience for devs and writers unfamiliar with Markdown (https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/9187)
  
Heavy discourse on Discord; personally reviewed all comments in 2 new
channels created by Ryan for technical details particular to the wallet
issues above:  

- \#wallet-connectors - representatives from Mlabs, GameChanger, Lace,
  BroClan, and Eternl discussing evolution of CIP-30, CIP-90 and API
  definitions common to Cardano's evolving needs
- \#query-layer-standard - particular discussion deriving from Vladimir
  Kalnitsky @ MLabs suggestion to incorporate query into the wallet;
  leading to prerequisite to standardise query layer itself

### Work on pull requests

\#467 - CIP-0088? \| Token Policy Registration

- Formatting changes for consistency with CIP database overall
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/467#discussion_r1397883203)
- Rigorous review after extensive re-write by co-editor Adam Dean:
  cross-checking editor, community, and subject matter expert feedback
  to verify resolution of all pending issues & request2s for
  clarification in the document
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/467#pullrequestreview-1749586125)
- This is a vital CIP which has been pending for 8 months and promises
  create a future-proof standard for token definition in Cardano...
  ensuring this is given the opportunity to progress at next possible
  CIP meeting ("Last Check")
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/467#issuecomment-1827110712)

  round of author's editing & anticipated progress at next CIP meeting

\#556 - CIP-0100? \| Governance Metadata

\#611 - CPS-0009? \| Coin Selection Including Native Tokens

  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/611#discussion_r1408280288)

\#612 - CIP-0072 \| Off-chain schema versioning and schema adjustments

- Disagreement by editors that semantic versioning makes sense here...
  we shouldn't take it for granted that this is helpful or even
  practical for a blockchain-based resource
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/612#discussion_r1396014763
  & comments thereafter)

\#617 - Web-Wallet Bridge - Mutlisig wallets

  primary participants in Wallet Interfaces discussion group)
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/617#issuecomment-1826481809)
- Continuing to correlating this new development with other extensions
  to CIP-30 and leaving open for other web-wallet bridges in the future

\#619 - CPS-0010? - Cardano Wallet Connectors

- Confirming author & general CIP editors' intention to version all such
  proposals; not all community members are aware of this change from
  prior standard
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/619#discussion_r1408235701)
- Addressing small naming issue
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/619#pullrequestreview-1753660689)

- Review, mostly for grammar & readability: ready to merge when workshop
  feedback accommodates all wallet dev points of view
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/619#pullrequestreview-1774152595)

\#620 - Extensive Light Wallet Standard

- Terminology used here reflects a coming division of wallet types
  according to their need of a query layer (currently under
  consideration
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/620#discussion_r1398230770)

\#623 - Dapp bridge rework

- Review of controversial new proposal to revise CIP-0030 - mainly
  document organisation & conventions for consistency with other CIPs
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/623#pullrequestreview-1749605256)
  with continued help putting this document into a standard & more
  usable format.
- Suggesting we resolve this controversy by following sentiment from
  meeting to demote this idea from a full revision of CIP-0030 to an
  extra serialisation method that wallets can offer voluntarily to
  dApps, to avoid burdening the developing Cardano wallet space
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/623#pullrequestreview-1753739819)
- Also important that we call this item very specifically... and allow
  for possibility that it will be \*either\* a big CIP-30 extension
  \*or\* its own interface
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/623#discussion_r1408372068)

\#624 - Integer-ByteString conversions

- Review of new Plutus language addition from MLabs - good proposal but
  needs further detail to be implemented as a fundamental change to the
  "builtin" language primitives
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/624#pullrequestreview-1749650428)

\#625 - CPS \| Query Layer Standardization

  agenda

\#628 - Multi-Stake Delegation from a Single Account

- Confirming, based on historical discussion going back 3 years, the
  likely problem of using stake pool "tickers" into on-chain data
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/628#discussion_r1411329410)

  discussion?
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/628#issuecomment-1837028715)

\#630 - CPS \| Ada token supply exhaustion 

- Proper categorisation as Ledger, not Token proposal, pending further
  review and likely dismissal as a "social" and therefore out-of-scope
  submission
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/630#pullrequestreview-1760609882)
- Not sure this is suitable for the CIP process at all, since mainly
  related to social perceptions: deserves critical review in that light
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/630#issuecomment-1837249525)
- Long, dismissive review of this proposal: detailed consideration
  against admitting it
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/630#pullrequestreview-1760973373)
