### MAJOR PROJECTS

Completed the CIPs Wiki (begun mid-2023) with positive community, editor & CIP reviewer feedback: containing detailed history & instructions for community members of any level to participate in the CIP process, including a complete description of what CIP editors do and how to ensure a sustainable process in the future (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/wiki)
- Discussion leading to the Wiki (since April): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/793

Completed the new CIP state tagging vocabulary, including a complete run-through of the CIP pull requests queue from the oldest to the newest items: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/883
- ensuring all CIP submissions have a verifiable status (closing ones veriably abanadone / deprecated): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/883#issuecomment-2307929334
- updating the repository front page so all community members can generate lists of CIPs under active consideration (or not progressing for various reasons): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/887
- further updating to include all CIP and CPS updates as well (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/891)
- planning further improvement (in future) of card-lane state automation (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/883#issuecomment-2308455979)

The above "state tagging" practically required my re-review of every currently open CIP/CPS pull request (about 77 when starting), with the eventual result of that number being cut to less than half when abandoned/deprecated submissions are closed: with the remaining half emerging as full-fledged CIPs or more robust candidates.

### Qualitative contributions

Reader-friendly "adminition" syntax in CIPs and CPSs... should we support it? (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/873#discussion_r1705894601)

Leading CIP process discussion of progressing or potential new CIP categories of
- `Consensus` (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/872#discussion_r1702422743)
- `Network` (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/876#discussion_r1710151948)

Adding open-source classic `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to CIPs repository, directing users to Wiki & creating an offline copy of it (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/881)

### Community discussions

How to use the CIP process to track protocol parameters, given the difficulties the CIP had in the first ledger eras beginning with Shelley & how to avoid the same problem again in the upcoming community governance era (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/852#issuecomment-2273768196)

Whether it is acceptable to keep implementation code in the CIP repository: what's our official policy?  Under what conditions would we make excpetions to it?
