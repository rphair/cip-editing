### Quantitative contributions

[CIP pull requests @rphair involved in, by last update time](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+involves%3Arphair+sort%3Aupdated-desc) = 69 in this period

[CIP issues @rphair involved in, by last update time](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+involves%3Arphair+sort%3Aupdated-desc) = 48 in this period

(These numbers are phenomally higher, especially for issues, because of the Catalyst Milestone "CIP Remediation" taking place at the end of Q4.)

### Qualitative contributions

As per this Catalyst project's Q1 milestone, created 42 new Pull
Requests (a record for any period of CIP implementation since the
beginning): to bring all CIPs up to date in formatting, implementation
("active" through delivery by specific parties vs. merely "proposed"),
and consensus with other editors regarding usefulness and stability.

Public discussion among editors and community members (e.g. Michael
Peyton Jones)  to add *Versioning* and other standard optional sections
to the CIP template and CIP-0001 guidelines.  Now that the 40+ CIPs are
all in standard format, the editorial team can more easily update them
with versioning requirements for future-proof development.  I've been
guiding this development through this issue and pull request:

\#730 (CIP-0001 \| Structure and template revisions) a medium size edit
to CIP-0001 and the CIP/CPS templates: mainly Versioning

- Issues come up from over 40 pull requests for the "remediation"
  project which make it clear we need a consistent treatment of
  Versioning: adding a mandatory section for CIPs for consistent use by
  CIP authors & more regular review and comprehension by implementors
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/730#issue-2056848047)
- Also adding several edits to fix errors in this document that have
  crept in in the last few months since the last overhaul by a previous
  editor.
- Nailing down specifics about whether text-only changes to a CIP are
  significant (these can be handled by GitHub itself)
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/730#issuecomment-1873429752)
- Trying to standardise formatting, as per issues that have come up in
  months since last CIP-0001 overhaul
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/730#discussion_r1439147899)
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/730#discussion_r1439149486)
- Revised template for including open source licenses
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/730#discussion_r1439757810)
- Debate with Michael Peyton Jones agreeing that Versioning should apply
  to multiple parts of a CIP but that Changelog is redundant and error
  prone relative to GitHub version control
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/730#issuecomment-1875956604)
- My working model that I believe includes all feedback expressed so far
  about Versioning & any optional CIP sections
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/730#issuecomment-1878125650)

\#731 - Add References section to CIPs/CPSs

- Debate with Michael Peyton Jones about whether CIPs (both authors +
  readers) are served by being able to add arbitrary sections; my belief
  = \*no\* with explanation of alternative means of presenting such
  material
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/731#issuecomment-1875862187)
- Response to MPJ to accommodate optional sections by defining some
  examples & keeping them out of the structure of mandatory sections
  (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/731#issuecomment-1878126980)

### Community discussions

Discord server has become very popular, with now about 20 people coming
regularly to CIP meetings (last year's record was 12), but the number &
variety of channels isn't reflected in the similar, older server name
"CIP Editors Meetings" so by popular choice with other editors I've
renamed it simply to "Cardano Improvement Proposals" to appear more
authoritative and to cover the increasing scope of our discussions
there.
