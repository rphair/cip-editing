### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Working with CF representative for [cips.cardano.org](https://cips.cardano.org) to improve web site specifications:
* Highlighting & confirming solution of long term problems affecting site usability:
  * Broken intra-CIP relative pathname links (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/51#issuecomment-3307042420)
  * Section outlining of CIP/CPS headers according to Markdown site builder standards (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/52#issuecomment-3306989630)
  * Provision of filtered selection of CIPs and CPSs, with presentation on an information-dense sidebar (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/53#issuecomment-3302561367)
* Proposing and writing specifications for comprehensive search features:
  * Links pointing to complete and reproducible queries: beyond the current arrangement only allowing selction of filters in a dialog box (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/60)
  * Vocabulalary terms allowing CIP editors and Cardano stakeholders to build reproducible lists of CIPs and CPSs meeting complex combinations of such filters (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/discussions/55)

... so that these long term CIP community needs can be addressed:
* On-demand display of:
  * CIPs which have been officially merged but are now "Waiting for Implemenation" and need community support before being progressed & eventually declared `Active` (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/863#issuecomment-3302589223)
  * CIPs which may be pending promotion from `Proposed` to `Active` status (or may have it prematurely applied) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/927#issuecomment-3323681801)
* Proper display (since GitHub can't do this) of finer categorisation than what's currently provided with our `Category` system (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1076#issuecomment-3302511719)
* Application of this "tagging" vocabularly to provide the same benefits believed to motivate creating the `CRC` (like Ethereum) in addition to the `CIP` (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1040#issuecomment-3302528920)
* Offering such categorisation to see if would resolve community requests for more frequent updates from Ledger team on CIP-relevant changes (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1028#issuecomment-3302540662)

Interaction with Leios representatives and IOG marketing to arrange CIP review primer and Leios review showcase on 02 October SPO monthly call (see 30 September 2025 SPO newsletter)

After intensive review of candidate CIP-0164 in "special" CIP meeting #120 (30 September), arranging special discussion forum for expert "chat" review:
* https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1078#issuecomment-3353296586
* [CIP Discord > #leios-cip-review](https://discord.com/channels/971785110770831360/1422634468069605439)

Acknowledging community suggestion to keep considering CIP process for possible inclusion in the Cardano Constituion (pending interest from constitution draft authors), and placing this on informal Summit agenda: https://x.com/COSDpool/status/1971852442586214764

Submitting trouble reports to GitHub Trust & Safety team about potentially malicious actors posting smart contract code segments to CIPs repository (complaint successful, though we'd already taken down the link) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1063#event-19744510790)

* Preparing detailed explanation for author (and potentially the CIP Wiki) about how to choose between different "footnote" linking styles: consistent with GitHub, Markdown best practice, and CIP common usage (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1083#discussion_r2318013576)
