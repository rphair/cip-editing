### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Presented CIP review process as part of a Leios theme in monthly SPO call: to re-introduce CIPs to Stake Pool Operators considering protocol changes such as Leios currently being finalised both as a standard and as CIP document.  Included demonstration of the CIP Wiki with review checklists and how to get involved through CIP discord and GitHub.

High-level discussions considering extension of CIP vocabulary (categoies and tags) and how CIPs could be more robustly searched and collated by development efforts & the Cardano community:
* Consideration of CIP-0112, best example of something that could be both `Plutus` and `Ledger`: invitiation to Ledger team to participate in discussion (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/749#issuecomment-3437382473)
* More emphatic calls for review, including presentation to stakeholders through this month's CIP meetings (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1076#issuecomment-3370573537)
* Identification with other Cardano community issues like how to identify CIPs with common technical interests & critical paths (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/1076#issuecomment-3370573537)
* Parallel progress on query syntax that would be required to make production use of a more practical & detailed vocabulary (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/60#issuecomment-3361160200)

Community criticism that CIPs can't be licensed because "there is no copyright holder"; rebuttal and discussion following from a repository issue (will stay in engaged in either case): https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1089#discussion_r2445827951

#862 - CIP-0118? | Nested Transactions
