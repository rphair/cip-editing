### Qualitative contributions

Some community pressure to move lists of participants (e.g. Acknowledgements for CIP-1694) to an appendix-like section instead of appearing right at the beginning.  I maintained this is vital for SEO reasons ("source ordering") and got consensus for new format convention with Abstract linking to the appendical section (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/763) and involving Ledger team in the discussion (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/763#pullrequestreview-1891011686).

Implemented change to CPSs to follow new standard for all of them to be open source licensed; including changes to the CPS specification and template, as well as a plan for phased changes to all existing CPS documents (both merged and in progress)

### Work on pull requests

#441 - CIP-???? | Post Quantum signatures and native wallets
- Renewed activity on another old & contended proposal (with community not agreeing 1 year ago about the urgency of this change).  Identifying major issue that needs to be settled first: a separation of the problem itself (needing to be in a CPS) from any proposed solution (the purpose of the CIP) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/441#issuecomment-1951809368)


#444 - CIP-0113? | Programmable token-like assets
- Catching up with a lot of editing done by author after taking over proposal: now positioned for demanding peer review from other subject matter experts (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/444#discussion_r1493779551)
- Insistence on RFC-2119 to standardise language for the details of the specification, with goal of removing ambiguities (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/444#issuecomment-1940779695)
- Promotion to candidate and coining the alternate name which does not use the "hated" term ERC20 (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/444#pullrequestreview-1865994917)

#632 - CIP-0108? | Governance Metadata - Governance Actions
- More about format of Governance documents (HTML vs. Markdown; finally ruling in favour of the latter as for CIP-0100) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/632#discussion_r1473958290)

#638 - CPS-0013? | Better builtin data structures in Plutus
- Rapid editorial flow and community support after a long period of deliberation; coordinating final changes & merge (and some cleanup after merge) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/638#pullrequestreview-1866009633)

#641 - CIP-0109? | Modular Exponentiation Built-in for Plutus Core
- Resolving deadlock so this could be merged; authors had not provided a Rationale upon request so we constucted one from the Motivation (which was really the Rationale in the wrong section) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/641#pullrequestreview-1869904525) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/641#discussion_r1480325224)

#679 - CIP-0110? | Plutus v1 compatible script references
- Approving review: based on good reception at CIP meetings and consensus of urgency in the community (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/679#pullrequestreview-1861501598)

#751 - CPS-0014? | Register of CBOR Tags
- Editing for formal compliance with CPS format and consistency with other CBOR proposals in this group submitted together (e.g. we've ruled they should have a `Tools` category since not just about "Metadata") (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/751#pullrequestreview-1866054813)

#752 - CIP-0114? | CBOR Tags Registry
- Helping to shorten a formerly cumbersome title (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/752#discussion_r1480385161)
- Insisting on correct category for these 3 related CBOR standards (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/752#discussion_r1483382173) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/753#pullrequestreview-1870901103)

#753 - CIP-0115? | CBOR tag definition - ED25519-BIP32 Keys
- Several cooperative review elements with co-editor @Crypto2099, e.g. (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/753#discussion_r1477073651)

#758 - CIP-???? | Transaction Inputs as List
- Exposing question for editors and author: if a CIP is about both Ledger and Plutus, which one takes precedence? (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/758#discussion_r1477077489)
