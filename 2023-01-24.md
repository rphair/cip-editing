Open pull requests (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pulls) = 50

Open issues (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues) = 29

### Qualitative contributions

Substantial community outreach required to disclose, and respond to, IOG's decision not to engage CIP authors about Rewards Sharing Scheme (staking parameter) proposals: effectively cutting off the entire CIP process on this issue.  Most authors were disturbed by this development yet we still have the ongoing responsibility of ensuring these authors' work is technically and historically documented.

Governance discussion continues on both Discord and Matrix with two slightly different user bases.  As the only CIP editor in both groups I've had to keep bridging CIP information between them, especially to remind the community repeatedly that the CIP process is an instrument of governance rather than a governance process itself.

### 2022-01-17 CIP Editors Meeting #60 (9:30am UTC)

[paradiso.app] remove transaction metadatum labels (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/405) Aaron Dunnington

-   MY INPUT
    -   it is NOT a CIP (it's administrative)
    -   commented before meeting: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/405#issuecomment-1384157757
        -   author & editor(s) need to respond about consequences of removing metadata label after metadata has already been published with that label.
    -   tagged Waiting for Author last night: RESOLVED & MERGED before meeting.

CIP-0052 | Add public keys to auditor table (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/406)

-   MY INPUT
    -   it is NOT a CIP (it's an update)
    -   in progress because still don't have keys from 3 of the 4 auditors.
        -   I've been progressing it in meantime (we got the key for MLabs)
    -   Only Las so far has been helpful in getting this info... IS HE HERE?
    -   tagged Waiting for Author saying we need help getting these keys
        -   commented before meeting (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/406#issuecomment-1384187402)

Bump express from 4.17.1 to 4.17.3 (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/416) AUTO

-   MY INPUT
    -   it is NOT a CIP (it's administrative)
    -   No reply from KT over 1 month ago about what we do with these (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/416#pullrequestreview-1215128297)
        -   duplicate of this unanswered comment (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/407#pullrequestreview-1210010578)
    -   MAIN QUESTION: is the site even being built anymore?  Looks really out of date to me.
        -   Also publicly asked that question, beginning of December (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/109#issuecomment-1333771465)
        -   auto-generated site looks NOT UPDATED SINCE AROUND OCT-NOV 2022.
        -   mainly this is a problem because CIP-0001 is completely wrong now and CIP-9999 isn't there at all.
    -   NOW SOME OTHERS - KT we need to know what to do with these:
        -   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/432 (moment)
        -   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/431 (minimatch)
    -   MERGED but we need to discuss: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/416#issuecomment-1384971263
        -   what does code do?
        -   what about (not currently) generated site?
-   answered by KT before meeting (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/416#issuecomment-1384981352) we just approve these mechanically since
    -   web site is built elsewhere anyway
    -   we've suspended the generated site built until CIPs are standardised via #389.

CIP-0075 | Fair Stake Pool Rewards

-   MY INPUT
    -   Had to break nonexistent word "Stakepool" into 2 words.  Subjective title is no big deal.
    -   Has ALREADY BEEN TRIAGED in November prior to assigning number 75 (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/360)
    -   NOTE IN MEANTIME lots of discussion on Cardano Forum, though in a separate thread (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/421#pullrequestreview-1250364032)
        -   A lot of that discussion is antagonistic & is also relevant to this CIP.
    -   also a trival formatting problem (already fixed for #422)

CPS-???? | Spending Script Redundant Execution (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/418) Icarus/Daidalos (Las Safin = antagonist)

-   MY INPUT
    -   Dialogue on GitHub about why this is necessary or NOT necessary.
    -   Thought & posted it might be ready for review (taking out of Draft), but it's pending discussion of related items currently taking place in #321 (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/321#issuecomment-1383184021)
    -   TO LINK & DISCUSS IN MEETING author comment with related PR threads:
        -   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/418#issuecomment-1384251009)

CIP-???? | Improved Rewards Scheme Parameters (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/422)

-   MY INPUT
    -   SUGGEST we should assign a number, given (if only) that CIP-0075 / #421 has one.
    -   Already pointed out that #421 and #422 should be one CIP (mentioned this online & in last meeting), but moot if there's no official classification for RSS CIPs anyway:
        -   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/387#pullrequestreview-1206808868) - for "Robin Hood" duplicate CIPs
        -   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/422#pullrequestreview-1235426080) - for this one.
-   RESOLULTION assign a number & merge as Inactive... due to RSS scope not encompassed by IOG.

CIP-0026 | Update signatures schema (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/424)

-   MY INPUT
    -   NOT a CIP.  Approved by Michael - a simple correction.
-   MERGED before meeting.

CIP-0036 | Fixed incorrect CDDL notation and incorrect keys in test vectors

-   MY INPUT
    -   NOT a CIP.  Approved by Kevin & Rooooooooob.
    -   KT, can/would you do this on the spot?

CIP-0005, CIP-0036 | Added clarity to voting key definitions (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/427) Ryan Williams

-   MY INPUT
    -   Seem to have concluded discussion, and updated CIP, of naming of new voting keys (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/427#issuecomment-1384285986)
    -   TO CHECK IF ALL IN AGREEMENT
    -   TO review & merge if so
        -   suggested in earlier comment (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/427#issuecomment-1384281244)
-   READY to merge now (Seba approved before meeting)
-   I merged in meeting... KT is going to get clarification from Catalyst about whether they'll be part of the CIP process.

CIP-???? | Adding encrypted messages to CIP-0020 (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/409) Martin Lang

-   MY INPUT
    -   Pre-meeting, settled on status as Active even though submitted as Proposed.
        -   CIP-0001 says either is acceptable if implementation list is partial.

        -   see my review comment (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/409#discussion_r1043426797)
        -   COMMENTED to qualify this AT MEETING (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/409#issuecomment-1384294680)
        -   Martin wants ACTIVE now... checking with Andrew Westberg.
    -   Text itself is ready to approve, as I see it:
        -   The fact that implementations exist means this is already "de facto" accepted.
    -   TO ASSIGN if so, a CIP number... this is how support for standard can be referenced.
    -   -   And ask them to change status from Proposed to Active, if not already.

-   as of meeting time, status still "Proposed"
