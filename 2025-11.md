### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Maintaining and moderating "virtual" activity through most of this month... accumulating a regular stream of new CIPs (processed & given first-order editor feedback when assigning the `Triage` tag on GitHub) before, during & after the Cardano Summit to maintain regular daily operations though several disruptions this month (including the "Mainnet incident").
