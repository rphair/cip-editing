### Qualitative contributions

2022-09-21 CIP Editors' retrospective meeting - held recently before this reporting period - with seminal members Matthias and Sebastien, and Cardano Foundation management attending as observer, we discussed:
- pending issues to make Discord meetings more efficient
- organising meeting agendas into CIP pull requests by theme (i.e. technology, such as NFTs or Plutus)
- pending changes to CIP process as documented in CIP-0001, forming the basis for further revisions by Matthias later this month: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/331
- making status changes to merged CIPs more readily visible to developers & the community
- a long term plan to recruit & retain more CIP editors, including a balance of unafilliated ("community") editors.

2022-09-27 CIP editor meeting #54 - attended
- meeting agenda Google Doc no longer available (I'll make copies of agendas of meetings beginning next monthly report cycle)
- minutes no longer transcribed due to ongoing technical problems: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/340#pullrequestreview-1128854339
- in addition to usual discussion, resolved to summarise transcriptions & our own notes of meeting resolutions into GitHub threads themselves.

2022-10-11 CIP editor meeting #55 - attended
- meeting agenda Google Doc no longer available (I'll make copies of agendas of meetings beginning next monthly report cycle).
- transcription not yet available from Cardano Foundation (may not be available in future either); in the meantime we are all expected to take our own notes of meetings & we are still getting used to the workflow for this.

Discord, GitHub & Forum
- discussions: assisted old & new proposers of CIPs for changing Cardano's CIP incentives (minimum fees, pledges and parameters,
saturation levels) in submitting & discussing their work.
- helped develop immature CIP submissions to progress PR's that have been stalled for months (e.g. [CIP-0048?](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/249))
