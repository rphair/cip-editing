#### CIP team progress

Open pull requests (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pulls) = 63 (about same as last month)

Open issues (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues) = 35 (increased due to governance feedback through IOG)

### Qualitative contributions

#### Subjective progress

Still had 2 meetings this month despite workshops & individual editor's unavailability.

-   Meeting 2023-07-18 postponed due to time off of other CIP editors after Edinburgh workshops last week.
-   Then postponed again on 2023-07-25 because not having confirmation any more than Ryan and I would be there (generally we've done all our reviews on GitHub already & still need review and consensus from other editors).

On Matrix I answered a question about regularity of the meetings and how advocates & observers could be more assured of the schedule in advance.  Excerpt of that message, with our resolution going forward:

-   We had a convenor from the CF that was handling meeting agendas & scheduling, but recently Ryan from IOG and I have been doing most of this ourselves. My hope is that editors themselves creating the meeting schedule & agenda items will allow the meetings always to proceed without any dependence on centralised administration.
-   (in fact this proved to be true for the rest of the month)

***NOTE to Catalyst administrators***: In the next & future monthly cycles I will be keeping a new monthly report format outline which will shorten the reports, make them easier to write and read, and avoid duplication between GitHub work and our group review at meetings.  From now I'll be recording each action taken *only once* in one of these 5 headings to include in each report:

-   Qualitative progress (hand written summaries)
-   Community discussions (with social links)
-   Work on pull requests (by each PR number)
-   Work on issues ([if any] by each issue number)
-   Meetings held (agenda links & notes not already made in PRs above)

#### GitHub activity

Continuing language standardisation (in this case, best effort old proposal CIP-50) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/582)

-   Agreement at CIP meeting to date translated documents as posted in PR branches to identify them uniquely.
-   Robert will update the specification for CIP-0001 as agreed at CIP meeting.

Major rewrite of CIP-0013 (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/559) ... enabling new "proof of onboarding" protocol to be the first developer-defined extension to this scheme.  Reviewed over last month & merged at 01 August meeting... and is already being used to consider other Cardano URI forms.

New standard for draft review... instead of internal comments (seen by author only, or people reading GitHub source), use tick-boxes to call attention to unanswered questions inline, rather than hiding them.

-   Case in point, "Governance Metadata standards" highlighted on the Cardano Forum for open review this month, with a test of this idea (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/556#pullrequestreview-1546284658)

CIP versioning: finally we have a proper framework to make immediate changes AND get community / developer feedback about what they want:

-   Closed issue for long timer versioning discussion & moved onto practical changes to CIP-1 (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/520#issuecomment-1651562472)
-   Particular drafts & edits for new versioning requirements for CIPs; my review & some more detailed language if needed (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/563#pullrequestreview-1548112282)
-   Preliminary (private) review of CIP versioning & categorisation CPS from Adam Dean who has tendered himself as a CIP editor (https://github.com/Crypto2099/CIPs/tree/versionioning-cps/CPS-XXXX)
-   Agreeing to keep discussion of "alternative" versioning schemes & requirements open in the long term: the issue "Versioning alternatives" (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/520#issuecomment-1652147896)
-   Potentially adding a "versioning update" to our planned remediation process for ALL old CIPs (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/563#issuecomment-1660405841)

New token standard for royalties; I did a detailed review... regarding support for different token types, how to separate them, and how to version the CIP68 protocol to indicate support for them... ultimately deciding that new token types will need separate CIPs beyond what's defined in CIP68 through the 444 token type:

-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/551#pullrequestreview-1549628189)
-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/551#issuecomment-1660781980)

Helped clean up very old proposal for web-based interprocess communication, mainly stalled since Dec 2022:

-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/395#pullrequestreview-1549697361)

NFT standards cleanup (CIP-0068 "image types") - documented versioning issue & discussion of whether to further clarify usage or remove it:

-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/562#pullrequestreview-1556551583)

New standard for expanded NFTs, separating individual tokens from common presentation & functional elements.  Reviewed to compare with other proposals still in the works or deprecated:

-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/530#pullrequestreview-1556992846)

#### GitHub progress (independently of meetings)

Meeting Merged long awaited "Authenticated Web3 HTTP requests" after multiple rounds of view.

-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/442#issuecomment-1639802273)

CIP-0381 | Adapt to Plutus bindings merged from meeting agenda... followed up by other editors after meeting & I merged it:

-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/506#pullrequestreview-1534495376)

Detailed review of new NFT clarification about use of images, with possible new version about which to coordinate with developers (e.g. pool.pm)

-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/562#pullrequestreview-1548445276)

#### 2023-08-05 CIP Editors Meeting #71

AGENDA (https://hackmd.io/@cip-editors/71)

##### Triage

CIP-0030 | Stipulate namespaced extension endpoints (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/577) - handled between author Ryan and Matthias.

CIP-0050 | Translations: fix Spanish metadata, remove Chinese (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/582)

-   Only item worth discussing: How much maintenance should we put into these "one-off", gratis, probably unmaintained translations?
-   That turned out not to be the issue, but rather that we should use a date when a commit hash isn't available for translations, i.e. when the source for the translation hadn't already been (and in CIP 50's case, never will be) a merged document in the repository.

##### Review

CIP-???? | Royalty Datum Metadata Standard (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/551)

-   Confirmed recently promosed co-editor will update CIP-0068 as agreed to do at las biweekly meeting.
-   Also relates to stalled PR#523 because CIP-0068 should include process for making changes to CIP-0067.  If only required & admissible for new token types, the "Ada SubHandle" request should be dropped... this item is still pending.
-   Reminded author after meeting he also still needs a Path to Active based on expectaions of coordination with NFT businesses especially those processing royalties (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/551#issuecomment-1679329012)

CIP-1694 | Semantic changes after the Edinburgh workshop (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/576) - handled between author Ryan and Matthias.

CIP-0093 | Update cross-CIP links to absolute paths (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/565)

-   I made a compatibility error with this one & have submitted it with required ./ prefix on CIP document pathnames for re-review (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/565#issuecomment-1679303923)

Items very quickly merged:

-   CIP-0068 | Improve image types and URI descriptions (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/562)
-   CIP-0030 | A few small fixes](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/570)
-   CIP-0050 | Fix relative links](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/574)
-   Fix or rationalise Adrestia links](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/575)

#### 2023-08-01 CIP Editors Meeting #70

Postponed in 2 weekly jumps from 18 July (I was in attendance without any other editors) and then 25 July due to continued absences.

AGENDA (https://hackmd.io/@cip-editors/70)

##### Triage

CIP-???? | Distributed Artifact Tokens Metadata Standard (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/530) from "Wout"

-   My review above was discussed a meeting, and we agreed to assign it as candidate with a number.

CIP-???? | Proof of Onboarding (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/546)

-   From Adam Dean recently promoted at co-editor.
-   I have updated CIP-0013 to make it compatible with this new addition to the URI scheme.
-   Also suggested it could be generalised to link to dApps in general.. I countered that this would require a longer URI string to generalise more functions; and therefore should be kept as-is.
-   Agreed to promote to candidate with a number, which I did the next day.

CIP-0068 Update | Add Royalty Support (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/551) - Sam Delaney

-   Author responsive on GitHub & review progressing well there; I invited him to Discord and the meeting.
-   Challenging review by Adam Dean (at a higher level than my own experience) - needs addressing.
-   Feedback to fork into separate CIP (outside of CIP-0068) was followed before end of this month.
-   Will be ready to promote to candidate as soon as author provides Path to Active, as requested after meeting # 71.

CIP-???? | Governance Metadata (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/556)

-   Excellent discussion & assigned CIP number in my updates after the meeting.

##### Review

CIP-0013 | Generalise for further protocols (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/559)

-   As I already posted, suggestions to revise existing protocols should be dismissed.
-   "Onboarding" (`//claim`) depends upon this being accepted.
-   Also CIP-0045 might use the generalised URI standard (e.g. //connect)
-   Merged at meeting.

CIP-0068 | Improve image types and URI descriptions (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/562) - Smaug

-   Preliminary review, leading to be merged after Meeting # 71.

CIP-0045? | Decentralized WebRTC dApp-Wallet Communication (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/395) - Fabian Bormann

-   I suggested potential inclusion of CIP-0013 URIs, so not ready to move along yet (author indicated he might change it accordingly).
-   I asked for clarification if we wants to do that (we're ready to move this ahead if not): (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/395#issuecomment-1660789544)... still pending at the end of this monthly report cycle.

CIP-0095? | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge Governance Extension (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/509) - still in progress led by Ryan & all documented on GitHub.

##### Last-check

CIP-0025 | Restrict to minting (positive amounts) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/527) - simple merge.

CIP-0050? | Pledge Leverage-Based Staking Rewards (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/242) - merged.

-   Author no longer involved... I'll take over (or coordinate) maintenance (Matthias did a comprehensive update it looks like?)
-   So far I've been handling metadata & translations in this monthly cycle & now it stands as the most rigorously reviewed candidate out of all the RSS proposals.
