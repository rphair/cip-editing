Acknowledged for contribution to candiate CIP-0120, the specification for the Cardano Constitution (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/796/files/2abb461a12e5551eb32f053e28c08c9ec1e82a10..54204796a1f1f200ae7005f6d3b8b2d804e69401).

Update of CIP-0001 to encourage CIP authors to immediately link posted CIPs to their source documents, enabling immediate review by editors and community members while reducing this routine task in CIP editor workflow (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/827).

### Community discussions

Successful follow-up with GitHub Technical support for reincarnation (under different account) of malicious spammer targeting the CIP repository (fake issues #807 and #808 with spam documents and malicious code links).
