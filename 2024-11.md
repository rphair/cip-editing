### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Suggestion of new Governance category, but with suddently-introduced provisions to accommodate "Social Governance" to potentially bypass voting and constitutionality rulings for procedures of human organisation and budgets, responding with these requirements:
- urging caution to separate newly expressed desire for "human governance" CIPs with a long-standing need to better define and categorise our "technical governance" CIPs (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/937#issuecomment-2468168150)
- countering a misrepresentation that this is being done as a matter of long-overdue consensus (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/937#issuecomment-2469789742)
- inviting Discord community of CIP reviewers, authors & advocates to provide feedback about suggestions to include Social Governance (https://discord.com/channels/971785110770831360/992011119872970762/1305596305271427084)
- offering a compromise to re-task a "template" of the CIP process toward the undeniably different requirements & process of (tentatively name) Cardano _Governance_ Proposals (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/937#issuecomment-2476061813)
- co-creating a new `Governance` category CIP draft (https://hackmd.io/@cip-editors/gov-cat-cip)

Eliminating unmaintainable CIP content from the Developer Portal & migrating community to cips.cardano.org instead (https://discord.com/channels/971785110770831360/992011119872970762/1313200239133331466)
