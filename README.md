These reports are intended to clarify the author's work on the CIP process as well as demonstrate the value and applicability of Catalyst funding, covering:
1. Regular role of CIP editor, shared with other CIP editors (see Contributors page & official list)
2. Individually funded community outreach, documentation efforts, daily communications and repository maintenance

The official Catalyst page for the current funding request (_Fund 14: Community CIP Editor Robert Phair: 6 month budget_) will be posted here when finalised by the Catalyst team in the 2nd half of August 2025.  Since the conclusion of the F
und 13 project at end of May 2025, work on the CIP process has continued daily in anticipation of funding being provided retroactively.
