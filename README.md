These reports are intended to clarify the author's work on the CIP process, as well as demonstrate the value and applicability of Catalyst funding to cover:
1. Regular role of CIP editor, in common with other CIP editors (see [Contributors](https://cips.cardano.org/contributors) page & [official editors list](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master#editors))
2. Individually funded community outreach, documentation efforts, daily communications and repository maintenance

### [Fund 14: Community CIP Editor Robert Phair: 6 month budget](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/14/cardano-open-ecosystem/community-cip-editor-robert-phair-6-month-budget)

This current (Q3-Q4 2025) Catalyst proposal is to support infrastructure and responsiveness in the CIP process by assuring a dedicated time budget to attend to these details every day (as reported in this repository) with ongoing documentation and other community efforts to keep standards relevant to the Cardano ecosystem.

Current & past proposals contain a roughly annual narrative summary of how the CIP process has evolved with the Cardano ecosystem each year. 

Since the conclusion of the Fund 13 project at end of May 2025, the author's work on the CIP process has continued in anticipation of funding being granted retroactively.  Previously funded projects (providing continuous CIP support):
