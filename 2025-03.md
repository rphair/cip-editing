### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Settling question of whether to separate the CIP & CPS repositories (we are _not_ separating them) (https://discord.com/channels/971785110770831360/992011119872970762/1346131222425768087)

Getting more emphatic response from GitHub Support about malicious spam targeting the CIP repository; surviving phishing attempt here (with all other participating accounts eradicated): (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/990)

Obtaining & debugging long awaited improvements to cips.cardano.org in form & function:
- sidebar & navigation (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/39#issuecomment-2762042276)
- Mermaid support, for flowcharts & diagrams (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/26#issuecomment-2762004391)
- relative pathnames pointing to source documents in same CIP directory were broken (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend/issues/41)
  - resolving long standing issue of our own (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/109#issuecomment-2766242111)

Groundbreaking steps being taken between institutional authors of academically oriented work and CIP editors to set a precedent how their work can be admissible in the CPS format (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/1009#pullrequestreview-2703740960)
