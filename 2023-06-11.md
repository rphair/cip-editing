- impossible to determine: GitHub outage & fix 5 days ago (many PRs in many repos had modtimes reset to that time)

[CIP issues @rphair involved in, by last update time](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+involves%3Arphair+sort%3Aupdated-desc) = ? in this period

[Cardano Forum CIP topics @COSDpool posted in since beginning of period](https://forum.cardano.org/search?q=%23developers%3Acips%20%40COSDpool%20after%3A2023-05-13) = 0 addressed in this period
- not much CIP activity on forum, but CIP discussion remains relevant by cross-referencing old CIPs with new topics, e.g. https://forum.cardano.org/t/decentralizing-cardano-frontends/118611/2

#### CIP team progress

Open pull requests (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pulls) = 63 (down from last month)

Open issues (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues) = 32

### Qualitative contributions

Team has had a good month for closing PRs and merging long standing CIP work: number of open PRs has again begun to decrease instead of increasing month on month.

I believe this can be further imrroved by not simply waiting for CIP authors to respond when a mixed CIP editor review is submitted.  For example, when a CIP author enquiried about the status & whether his document was ready to merge, it presented a good opportunity to review all unresolved comments which causes GitHub to send a separate email about each one of them, giving the author incentive to finally close all outstanding issues.  This approach has worked very well recently with this popular but stalled CIP: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/499

Also prompt intervention from the CIP team has averted a crisis where the Blockfrost team believed CIP-0068 was lacking a versioning strategy in a way that made their implementation impossible to confirm standards compliance.  This issue I submitted has achieved a short term solution & will be useful in avoiding similar problems in the future, as well as ultimately introducing a consideration of versioning as a required part of the CIP process itself defined in CIP-0001: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/520
