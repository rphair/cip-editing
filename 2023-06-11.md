### Quantitative contributions

[CIP pull requests @rphair involved in, by last update time](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+involves%3Arphair+sort%3Aupdated-desc) = ? in this period
- impossible to determine: GitHub outage & fix 5 days ago (many PRs in many repos had modtimes reset to that time)

[CIP issues @rphair involved in, by last update time](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+involves%3Arphair+sort%3Aupdated-desc) = ? in this period
- impossible to determine for same reason

[Cardano Forum CIP topics @COSDpool posted in since beginning of period](https://forum.cardano.org/search?q=%23developers%3Acips%20%40COSDpool%20after%3A2023-05-13) = 0 addressed in this period
- not much CIP activity on forum, but CIP discussion remains relevant by cross-referencing old CIPs with new topics, e.g. https://forum.cardano.org/t/decentralizing-cardano-frontends/118611/2

#### CIP team progress

Open pull requests (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pulls) = 63 (down from last month)

Open issues (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues) = 32

### Qualitative contributions

Team has had a good month for closing PRs and merging long standing CIP work: number of open PRs has again begun to decrease instead of increasing month on month.

I believe this can be further imrroved by not simply waiting for CIP authors to respond when a mixed CIP editor review is submitted.  For example, when a CIP author enquiried about the status & whether his document was ready to merge, it presented a good opportunity to review all unresolved comments which causes GitHub to send a separate email about each one of them, giving the author incentive to finally close all outstanding issues.  This approach has worked very well recently with this popular but stalled CIP: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/499

Also prompt intervention from the CIP team has averted a crisis where the Blockfrost team believed CIP-0068 was lacking a versioning strategy in a way that made their implementation impossible to confirm standards compliance.  This issue I submitted has achieved a short term solution & will be useful in avoiding similar problems in the future, as well as ultimately introducing a consideration of versioning as a required part of the CIP process itself defined in CIP-0001: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/520

Also I have arranged an open invitation from the Plutus team, thanks to Michael Peyton-Jones, in which we are now free to request their attendance and input at CIP meetings whenever Plutus CIPs are up for review.

### 2023-06-06 CIP Editors Meeting #67 4:30PM (UTC)

Actually 3:30PM UTC if beginning as I am observing from Discord at 9PM local time in India (GMT+5:30)

AGENDA (https://hackmd.io/@cip-editors/67)

#### Triage

CIP-0094? | Update process duration (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/516)

-   DONE via primary PR ahead of meeting after my requests on GitHub & private channel on Discord.

#### Review

CIP-0069? | Plutus Script Type Uniformization (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/321) Maksymilian 'zygomeb' Brodowicz

-   KT has pushed through a bunch of changes so believe the "Last Check" label should be effective for this agenda & we should MERGE IT NOW.
    -   commented as such before meeting (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/321#pullrequestreview-1465446757)
-   KT still not happy with how explicit it is... could it be recycled as a CPS?
    -   Or is there one that's already relevant to it?
    -   YES - Plutus Script Usability... where it already was included in that CPU.
-   KT says he'll add something for my suggestion about metadata.
    -   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/496#pullrequestreview-1465358443
-   still lacks a proper specification... but not a problem since no implementors & only suggested to merge Proposed (hence my positive review).
-   so KT is approving & merging, with comment to this effect.

CIP-0056? | Treasury donations (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/269)

-   Today we're getting all of SEBA's proposals.
-   This is also antiquated & needs a re-work if continuing, or to be dropped.
    -   Not a lot of response on this one.
    -   Could use more consideration in regard to Catalyst re-work of their apps in the last few months.
-   and needs CIP-0001 re-work.. especially
    -   PATH TO ACTIVE which should definitely INVOLVE CATALYST, right?
-   MY GUESS is that this is a brainstorm which the last year's market uncertainty & Catalyst remodel has made obsolete.
-   FYI
    -   People would be in favour of this but community has been very much against including "investment" in the means of increasing the treasury.
-   no response from IOG yet other than people saying "sounds interesting" but Seba hasn't had time to work on it... so we converted back to Draft in the meeting.
    -   KT is putting an explanatory comment about it; as I would put it this proposal is in "limbo" without the author being sure he will continue with it.
-   In meeting I said that Catalyst had made a lot of improvements in last 6 months, and talks about them in Forum postings a lot, e.g. (https://forum.cardano.org/t/catalyst-weekly-79-town-hall-128-catalyst-continuous-testnet/118462)
    -   BUT after meeting I went to check & there's nothing about accounting for donations.
    -   In fact in my own experience of trying to a refund of an overpayment & then get it back again, I was shocked how extremely inflexible their accounting system still is.

CIP-0038? | Arbitrary Script as Native Script spending conditions (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/309)

-   No activity for a few weeks, but discussion still ongoing.
    -   other than recent comment about whether this CIP would make wallets indistinguishable from end user addresses
        -   MY UNDERSTANDING is that it does not & this last comment was a "red herring" amidst the other technical suggestions.
-   Sebastien (also expected @ meeting): coincident with CIP-0039, so:
    -   How are you pushing this forward?
    -   Like CIP39 this also seems to be a reference for a certain way of doing things; can it therefore be merged as Proposed?
    -   If it can't be agreed on as a method, what about CPS statement of problem & indication about how this can solve it?
    -   IF WANTING TO MERGE: LIKE cip39 needs a re-work as per CIP-0001 since header, document sections, header level & all the usual things are wrong.
-   From my level I don't see why the technicahttps://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/502l suggestions are really necessary & will always be matters of opinion.
    -   Regarding these questions I think our policy has always been to merge as Proposed... but WITH a description of how implementations would make it become Active.
-   WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO ACTIVE and it reads like a blog entry (all use cases) rather than a CIP.
    -   Seba can't get a response from IOG about it... but then Ledger team would have to get a more precise spec to see if they can do it.

    -   KT suggested pinging back the ledger team to see how/what they could do with it.
-   Seba will update & put in Path to Active.  (THEN I'll review for other format isuees.)

CIP-0039? | Language annotated address (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/310) (SEBA)

-   no activity since OCTOBER 2022 !
-   Sebastien (looks like he's planning on coming to meeting, since active on Github now):
    -   would it be fair to say this can be merged as a reference document, since so many other proposals have referred to it in last 7+ months?
    -   IF NOT then it should be dropped.
    -   IF SO it also needs a re-work as per CIP-0001 since header, document sections, header level & all the usual things are wrong.
-   mainly, again WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO ACTIVE.
-   Seba will update & put in Path to Active.  (THEN I'll review for other format isuees.)

#### Last-check

CIP-0084? | Ledger evolution (meta) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/456)

-   I've double checked this before every meeting (I approved on 08 Feb) & think we are simply ready to:
    -   DO ONE MORE REVIEW... can someone do it on the spot?
    -   HIT THE BUTTON.
-   Last discrepancy was whether Ledger category can be applied to RSS proposals.
    -   CIP currently says YES but KT thinks NO but never really disputed it that much in last 3 months.
    -   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/456#issuecomment-1467635629)
-   FOR ME TO DO: AFTER CIP-84 is merged (pending definition of what an RSS "expert" is), with Ledger OK for RSS proposals, I will:
    -   submit PR to
        -   apply the Ledger category to the very old ones
        -   reactivate the more recent Inactive proposals
    -   notify Discord & Element that the RSS proposals are now applicable as Proposed & CIP repo has been updated.
    -   I summarised (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/456#issuecomment-1579110371)

CIP-0072? | DApp Registration & Discovery (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/355) @ehanoc = Bruno Martins & @matiwinnetou = Mateusz Czeladka)

-   NOT READY FOR LAST CHECK (which I added) and I propose we take it off and mark "Waiting for Author" instead...
    -   TO MARK AS SUCH based on whether ehanoc comes to meeting
    -   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/355#issuecomment-1578910221)
        -   "last check" applied after CIP meeting 3 weeks ago was supposing author's cooperation on upcoming code reviews, which has not happened in that time.
-   Mateusz is here but he doesn't have a lot of time to work on this.
    -   KT suggestion: leave "Implementors" as empty!
    -   TO COMMENT @mati - you can leave Implementors as empty if you want to merge it as written... although @mati says that zero implementors often leads to an unused standard ("chicken & egg").
-   So he's agreed to do that.... therefore can leave on Last Check.
    -   I commented to summarise (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/355#issuecomment-1579122491)

CIP-0060 | Update to v2 (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/502)

-   I passed it back in April but it missed a couple meeting cycles to get "Last Check"ed.
-   Seba passed it before meeting, so READY TO HIT THE BUTTON now.
-   Only pending change I've noted before, which is promised for V3 (updating some naming & documentation):
    -   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/502#issuecomment-1513359880
-   MERGED at meeting.

#### Issues

CIP-0068 versioning and similar cases (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/520) - by ME

-   I added new section for this Agenda but think it will be helpful in future meetings.
-   Q: do we have to put a 2 in the number?
-   Q: let's introduce a section & header to CIP-0001... maybe also in header.
    -   That means putting all
-   **TODO** put meeting notes in issue (Ryan is noting up the agenda)
-   **TODO** create a PR to do the needful with CIP68 & invite Marek & Ales & Andrew

### 2023-05-16 CIP Editors Meeting #66 8:30AM (UTC)

MY AGENDA SUGGESTIONS & COMMITMENTS - both scheduled for Review.

-   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/442#issuecomment-1541837407 (Authenticated Web3 HTTP requests)
-   CIP-???? | On-chain dApp Certification Metadata #499 - Romain asked "how to we expedite this"
    -   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/499#pullrequestreview-1376320412 (reviews not responded to yet by authors: suggested 3 days before meeting that these points be addressed & hopefully declare it to be a candidate at the meeting if all clear)

#### Triage

CIP-0085 | Add an alternative about unsaturated constr/case

-   JUST A DOCUMENTATION UPDATE so can be checked in ON THE SPOT.

#### Review

CIP-???? | Authenticated Web3 HTTP requests (@jmagan / Juan Salvador Magán Valero) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/442

-   I've already passed it & believe it should be promoted to Candidate.
-   All responses to KT and matiwinnetou ([Mateusz Czeladka](https://keybase.io/matiwinnetou)) [CIP72 author] have been addressed... so fine even to move to Last Check if review goes well at this meeting.
-   Noted on Discord & Github to assign an official CIP number (KT generally does this).

CIP-0062? | Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge Catalyst Extension (@ehanoc = Bruno Martins?) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/296

-   Ryan is a co-author: he should take this one & field the reviews.
-   Progressing along with no status changes.

SPONTANEOUS - matiwinnetou showed up - https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/355

-   @KT NEED TO REVIEW - note on Agenda & Github.
-   ALREADY being implemented by authors.
    -   chicken-egg since they'd been waiting for merge perhaps to get more adoption for this?  While it's likely the other way around.
-   marked LAST CHECK in light of merge as Proposed, with my own approving review: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/355#pullrequestreview-1428139625

CIP-0069? | Plutus Script Type Uniformization (@zygomeb = "Max" Maksymilian 'zygomeb' Brodowicz) https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/321

-   STALLED for 2.5 months... editor approve & merge already?  Or deprecate?
-   Discussion from KT and members of Plutus / mLabs would be welcome.
-   have to move this along... merge as proposed (tag KT) unless Plutus (tag Mlabs / Las) have serious reservations.
-   MY SUMMARY (which should be this in for final review next CIP meeting #67):
    -   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/321#pullrequestreview-1428157689

CIP-??? | On-chain dApp Certification Metadata

-   Romain says he addressed all the review comments & IS HERE today:
    -   Gave review both of existing proposal & yesterday's updates in response to communication review.
-   mainly dialogue between him & Ryan... all favourable regarding existing draft & recent updates & clarifications.
-   Ryan also giving more of a review in near future.
-   Noted on Discord & Github to assign an official CIP number (KT generally does this).

#### Last-check

MY SUGGESTION: 2 related deprecations from old "metadata pointer" proposals

-   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/249 (CIP itself)
    -   already NOTED intent to close/deprecate: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/249#issuecomment-1531857843
-   https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/343 (extension tag update for CIP25)
    -   TO NOTE when closing / deprecating AT MEETING probably (I WILL DO IT)
-   A lot of "work" went into these & editorial interest, but nothing from the community except Adam Dean who found it relatable to CIP88
    -   but author's help would have been required to close the gap, which never happened.
