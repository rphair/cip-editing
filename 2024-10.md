### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Long awaited update of CIP-0001 with changes pending from this year (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/924):
- Fixed title, appearing as documentation anchor on other sites (and therefore should be "CIP Process")
- Suggesting labels for lists in CIP headers (improving readability)
- Fixed anchor syntax for compability with other CIP web sites
- Added instructive / practical links to further detail on CIP Wiki
- Rewritten section on Versioning (for more flexible document structure according to author preference)
- Rewritten section on Enlistment (for more denentralised Cardano development; fixing https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/898)
- New CIP categories `Network` and `Consensus`
- Added section honouring Emeritus editors (initially set to original CIP editing team convened in 2020)
- After 2-year period of many updates & rewrites, added self as co-author.

Attempting again to reconcile consistency problem between [cips.cardano.org](https://cips.cardano.org/) and our GitHub CIP archive:

Successful campaign to get 500+ stars on GitHub CIPs repostitory (so CIP Wiki, including Cardano standards processes & achievements, will be indexed by search engines):
- https://forum.cardano.org/t/the-cips-github-repository-needs-26-more-stars/136237
- https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1fy2c1s/the_cips_github_repository_needs_11_more_stars

Editor suggestion to build CIP lists automatically on front repository page (an eventual improvement to CIP process, continuing previous effors) (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/929#issue-2594044274)
