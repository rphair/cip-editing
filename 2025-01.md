### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

Helping authors/reviewers (e.g. Polina) overcome difficulties with "Verification" as ambiguously defined by Discord on our CIP Discord server: sometimes leaving users without ability to access CIP discussion groups, events & meetings (by PM).

Identifying & correcting problem with Luma meeting scheduler app (https://lu.ma/cardano-cip) "running out" of CIP meetings at the end of 2024 (by PM with users & editors).
