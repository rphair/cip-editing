#### CIP team progress

Open pull requests (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pulls) = 60 (queue shrinking for first time in over a year)

Open issues (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues) = 36 (about the same)

### Qualitative contributions

Most active work coordinated with the community has been tagging methods used by Cardano wallets (CIP-30) with CIP numbers (or placeholders) for extensions, so these can proceed independently: with progress in naming, versioning, and code endpoints for these extensions.

Likewise CIP-68 is being extended so that new token types (beyond the first 4 created & integrated in the proposal) will require new CIPs and therefore can also proceed independently.

In response to the number of CIP related proposals appearing in Catalyst Fund 10, I have documented the CIP process for Cardano & general blockchain audiences in this series of articles:

Extended CIP-0001 to allow for translations not checked into main GitHub repo (#585) (i.e. "unofficial" translations identified by only a date & author)

Establishing precedent about whether experimental CIP implementations demonstrate that they are Active

-   beginning here (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/587/commits/675c96579936e5b18a4a43c2a96971ee9408531d#r1318766781)

### Community discussions

Comment about code ownership for "Cardano Swaps" (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/418#issuecomment-1683441424) led to a community posting about ownership (by CF perhaps) of Cardano code with regulatory liability (https://github.com/fallen-icarus/cardano-swaps/discussions/8)

-   Author of "Cardano Swaps" (fallen-icarus) present agreed to submit question about legal liability & code ownership to CIPs repo issue queue, for attention of CF and IOG (discussion currently has no associate PR or issue)
-   In meantime agreed that fully developed CIPs should precede any official request to turn over code ownership from open source developers to Cardano agencies.

Facilitating JPG store engineer volunteering for help clarifying our long time token standards, and laying out a plan for building a community discussion around it (https://discord.com/channels/971785110770831360/992011119872970762/1141644637329686538) to:

-   refine the language itself when it causes standards implementations to become undependable because the criteria are too loose
-   update and/or create new CIPs to reflect that the industry practice has often diverged from what's in these CIPs ("CIP25, CIP27, CIP68, etc")

Broadening the discussion of pending Cardano Swaps and Cardano Loans (new tech for P2P markets)

-   Introducing CF and CPS-0004 author to each other, with CF and IOG editor oversight planned at 29 August meeting, to look at potential non-CIP issues of maintenance and legal ownership of software with potential liability issues (https://github.com/fallen-icarus/cardano-swaps/discussions/8#discussioncomment-6760890)

Facilitated forum discussion (prior to GitHub) of several draft CIPs from single author to avoid huge traffic on GitHub from a number of rough proposals only in ideation & community feedback state (https://forum.cardano.org/t/blueprint-nft-overview-thread/120812)

### Work on pull requests

#418 - CPS-0004? | Spending Script Redundant Execution

-   Assuring maintenance over a CPS, so far stalled due to requiring development time and perhaps Catalyst funding for practical implementations, as a joint effort between the author and a developer at the Cardano Foundation while answering questions about open source licensing and code responsibility / ownership (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/418#issuecomment-1683441424)

#524 - CIP-0101 | Integration of keccak256 into Plutus

-   Finally promoted to CIP number (I have been monitoring & check-listing for compliance with CIP-0035, interfacing with the Plutus devs for a few weeks) and it's ready to merge.

#530 - CIP-0098? | Distributed Artifact Token Metadata

-   Author seems disinterested in pursuing other than documentation of his own implementation; encouraging author to respond to a likely interest in broadening the "standard" OR editor's deprecating the proposal without any additional applications (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/530#issuecomment-1707085080)

#577 - CIP-0030 | Stipulate namespaced extension endpoints

-   Addressing general community recommendation that CIPs numbers also contain version tags: resisting this as usual, but asking if those version tags could / should be included in the wallet APIs when compatibility might be an issue (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/577#pullrequestreview-1582029846)

#580 - CIP-???? | Blueprint NFT

-   This incomplete "placeholder" CIP was submitted prematurely and was probably promotional for Catalyst (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/580#pullrequestreview-1611626420)... it is a sensitive issue to suggest this about a CIP submission but I've had to be assertive that the CIP process needs to be used properly: including the suggestion to prepare material outside of GitHub (e.g. the Cardano Forum) before submitting a PR.

#585 - CIP-0001 | Allow ISO date if translation source uncommitted

-   Authored (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/585)

#586 - CIP-0067, CIP-0068 | Add Clarification for Edits and Modification

-   First review on proposal officially allowing new token types to be defined in CIP documents separate from CIP-68; mainly identifying requirement for versioning to be defined in these new CIPs as well (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/586#pullrequestreview-1605679900)

#587 - CIP-30 ext: Bulk transaction signing

-   Assisted in the revamp of this popular proposal which had been abandoned by the author (taken over by new author with the CF) & done first review after rewrite.
-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/443#issuecomment-1682322856)
-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/587#pullrequestreview-1608562582)

#593 CIP-0025 | Change "NFT" to "token"

-   Robert offered to play "Devil's Advocate" for this proposition to argue that CIP-0025 serves a historical purpose in the language it used at the time vs. CIP-0068 which covers the modern evolution to FTs and RFTs with metadata (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/593#pullrequestreview-1629895307)

### Work on issues

#590 - Determining naming convention for extensions to CIP-0030 (formulating based on our decision in the last CIP meeting now that these proposals are moving forward)

-   (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/590#issuecomment-1712646540)
