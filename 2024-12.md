### Qualitative contributions & Community interaction

CIP content has been migrated out of the Cardano Developer Portal, where it was difficult to maintain, to emphasise a more useful location at `cips.cardano.org` maintained by unknown parties at the Cardano Foundation.  Efforts continue to ensure proper support at this new location for proper sync with content on GitHub and for improving theming & layout issues, and also to involve the developer community in reporting any issues of CIP/CPS content standardisation & readability:
